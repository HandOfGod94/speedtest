# Speedtest

:construction: **Work In Progress** :construction:  
:construction: **Proceed with caution** :construction:

Small CLI app to run speedtest on terminal

## Quickstart

- TBD

## Why?
- I hate going fast.com everytime to check my internet speedtest

## Why dart?
- Earlier implementation in go was quite verbose and I didn't quite like it
- Dart ticks almost all the boxes I want (null safe, static type, binary distribution, DSL-ish syntax) except
    for functional programming paradigm.
- Explore DOP (Data oriented programming) and see how it fit's into Declarative nature of dart
